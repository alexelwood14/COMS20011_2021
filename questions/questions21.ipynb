Contrast would work similar to colour, this would be taken from the center of the fourier transform. Roundness can be measured by comparing how rotationally symmetric the fourier transform and would work well at comparing the Red Pears to the other fruits. Size would work well at comparing Satsumas and Oranges.\n",
